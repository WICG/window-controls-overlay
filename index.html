        This document specifies a set of technologies that allow a Web
        developer to customize the title bar of an installed web application
        running in a desktop environment. These technologies are known as
        Window Controls Overlay (<abbr title=

        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        Applications targeting non-mobile devices are hosted within frames that
        commonly have a title bar. A title bar is a UI element generally
        represented as a horizontal bar at the top of a window, bearing the
        name of the active program or the name of the current active document
        and and the [=window controls=]. Modern applications can take advantage
        of the area in the title bar in order to display UI content to create a
        better UX.
      </p>
      <p>
        For installed web apps hosted within a user agent (UA) frame, it is
        possible to get some form of customization in the frame by declaring
        which type of display mode is preferred. Developers can select the mode
        that best meets the needs of the application via the [=manifest=]
        file's `display` member. However, these modes are limited and do not
        provide the same level of control over the title bar, therefore
        developers looking to create an immersive, native-like title bar for
        their installed application can't achieve this with the aforementioned
        member. Instead, the client area begins immediately below the reserved
        title bar region, which can create a cramped application space
        specially on portable devices with smaller screens.
      </p>
      <p>
        WCO enables the creation of custom title bar UI by leaving only the
        [=window controls=] [=overlaid=] on the frame, in which case web
        content can flow into the area previously held by the title bar.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <dfn>Window Controls Overlay</dfn>: feature for installed web
          applications running on non-mobile environments that allows the
          viewport to expand over the [=title bar area=] using JS and CSS.
        </li>
        <li>
          <dfn>Title bar area</dfn>: When WCO is enabled, this is the the
          region of the window frame occupied by the title bar without the area
          corresponding to the [=overlay=] that houses the [=controls of the
          window=].
        </li>
        <li>
          <dfn data-lt="controls of the window">Window controls</dfn>:
          interface elements that the operating system uses consistently across
          applications to enable the user to perform certain actions to control
          the application. Common actions in the [=window controls=] include
          minimize, maximize/restore, and close buttons.

            Spoofing risks
          </h4>
          <p>
            Displaying installed web apps in a frameless window leaves room for
            developers to spoof content in what was previously a trusted,
            UA-controlled region.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently in Chromium browsers, `standalone` mode includes a title
            bar which on initial launch displays the title of the webpage on
            the left, and the origin of the page on the right (followed by the
            "settings and more" button and the window controls). After a few
            seconds, the origin text disappears.
          </p>
          <p>
            In RTL configured browsers, this layout is flipped such that the
            origin text is on the left. This open the window controls overlay
            to spoofing the origin if there is insufficient padding between the
            origin and the right edge of the overlay. For example, the origin
            "evil.ltd" could be appended with a trusted site "google.com",
            leading users to believe that the source is trustworthy.

          <h4>
            Out-of-scope Navigation
          </h4>
          <p>
            Another existing security feature for installed web apps is an
            indicator of when a user has left the declared scope of the app.
            When a user navigates out of scope, a black bar appears between the
            title bar and the web content, and it includes the following
            information:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A close button to allow users to easily navigate back into
            scope
            </li>
            <li>A security icon which opens the security info popup when
            clicked
            </li>
            <li>The origin and title of the site
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            With the window controls overlay enabled, if a user navigates
            out-of-scope the overlay will be temporarily replaced with a
            standalone title bar. When the user navigates back to into scope,
            the standalone title bar will be hidden again and the overlay
            displayed.

          Enabling Window Controls Overlay poses an increased fingerprinting
          surface since the size of the overlay can vary depending on the OS,
          the text scale, the OS font size, the OS zoom factor, and the web
          content‚Äôs zoom factor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although this is a potential fingerprinting issue, it only applies to
          installed desktop web apps that use the window controls overlay
          feature and does not apply to general browser usage. Additionally,
          the windowControlsOverlay API will not be available to iframes
          embedded inside of an installed web app.
