        This document specifies a set of technologies that allow a Web
        developer to take control over the area that would generally be
        occupied by the title bar in an installed web application running on a

        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        Applications targeting non-mobile devices are hosted within frames that
        commonly have a title bar. A title bar is a UI element generally
        represented as a horizontal bar at the top of a window, bearing the
        name of the active program or the name of the current active document
        and and the [=window controls=]. Modern applications can take advantage
        of the area in the title bar in order to display UI content to create a
        better UX.
      </p>
      <p>
        For installed web apps hosted within a user agent (UA) frame, it is
        possible to get some form of customization in the frame by declaring
        which type of display mode is preferred. Developers can select the mode
        that best meets the needs of the application via the [=manifest=]
        file's `display` member. However, these modes are limited and do not
        provide the same level of control over the title bar, therefore
        developers looking to create an immersive, native-like title bar for
        their installed application can't achieve this with the aforementioned
        member. Instead, the client area begins immediately below the reserved
        title bar region, which can create a cramped application space
        specially on portable devices with smaller screens.
      </p>
      <p>
        WCO enables the creation of custom title bar UI by leaving only the
        [=window controls=] [=overlaid=] on the frame, in which case web
        content can flow into the area previously held by the title bar.

        <p>
          The WCO feature is useful in environments that use the paradigm of a
          window to house applications. Notches, irregular shaped viewports or
          layout of content around hardware constraints is outside of the scope
          of the spec.
        </p>
        <p>
          The window paradigm for desktop-like environments is UX that has
          proven effective at managing information architecture over decades.
          It is a paradigm that continues to evolve, and part of this evolution
          is allowing modern apps to take control of the area of the window
          that was before reserved for the title bar. WCO enables this in the
          same way that apps created with native technologies can take
          advantage of today.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Notches and other hardware elements do not interfere with the
          title bar region of any app window on any platform</strong>. They can
          intersect parts of the OS such as the status or menu area, and this
          is handled entirely by the host OS. The WCO feature does not deal
          with any area that can be intersected by a notch.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notches do not leave considerable space to work with, can be in
          arbitrary positions, and not necessarily be rectangular.
          Additionally, most GUI guidelines from vendors that implement notches
          to maximize screen-body ratio on their devices recommend not to
          position content around the notch.

            The client viewport does not make any special considerations when

            displayed in the same way that it would be displayed inside the
            browser window. In order to avoid content being hidden by the area
            where the [=window controls=] are [=overlaid=], developers need to

            Displaying installed web apps in a frameless window leaves room for
            developers to spoof content in what was previously a trusted,
            UA-controlled region.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently in Chromium browsers, `standalone` mode includes a title
            bar which on initial launch displays the title of the webpage on
            the left, and the origin of the page on the right (followed by the
            "settings and more" button and the window controls). After a few
            seconds, the origin text disappears.
          </p>
          <p>
            In RTL configured browsers, this layout is flipped such that the
            origin text is on the left. This open the window controls overlay
            to spoofing the origin if there is insufficient padding between the
            origin and the right edge of the overlay. For example, the origin
            "evil.ltd" could be appended with a trusted site "google.com",
            leading users to believe that the source is trustworthy.

            Another existing security feature for installed web apps is an
            indicator of when a user has left the declared scope of the app.
            When a user navigates out of scope, a black bar appears between the
            title bar and the web content, and it includes the following
            information:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A close button to allow users to easily navigate back into
            scope
            </li>
            <li>A security icon which opens the security info popup when
            clicked
            </li>
            <li>The origin and title of the site
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            With the window controls overlay enabled, if a user navigates
            out-of-scope the overlay will be temporarily replaced with a
            standalone title bar. When the user navigates back to into scope,
            the standalone title bar will be hidden again and the overlay
            displayed.

          Enabling Window Controls Overlay poses an increased fingerprinting
          surface since the size of the overlay can vary depending on the OS,
          the text scale, the OS font size, the OS zoom factor, and the web
          content’s zoom factor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although this is a potential fingerprinting issue, it only applies to
          installed desktop web apps that use the window controls overlay
          feature and does not apply to general browser usage. Additionally,
          the windowControlsOverlay API will not be available to iframes
          embedded inside of an installed web app.
